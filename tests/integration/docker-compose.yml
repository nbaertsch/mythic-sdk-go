# This docker-compose file is a placeholder for integration tests.
# Mythic C2 Framework requires the full repository and mythic-cli to run.
#
# NOTE: CI/CD uses full Mythic installation instead of docker-compose.
# See .github/workflows/integration.yml for the automated CI setup.
#
# To run integration tests with a live Mythic instance:
#
# Option 1: Use an existing Mythic instance
#   export MYTHIC_URL="https://your-mythic-server:7443"
#   export MYTHIC_USERNAME="your_username"
#   export MYTHIC_PASSWORD="your_password"
#   go test -v -tags=integration ./tests/integration/...
#
# Option 2: Set up Mythic locally
#   1. Clone Mythic: git clone https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic.git
#   2. cd Mythic && sudo make
#   3. sudo ./mythic-cli start
#   4. Wait for Mythic to be ready (https://127.0.0.1:7443)
#   5. Run tests with default credentials:
#      export MYTHIC_URL="https://127.0.0.1:7443"
#      export MYTHIC_USERNAME="mythic_admin"
#      export MYTHIC_PASSWORD="<password from .env file>"
#      go test -v -tags=integration ./tests/integration/...
#
# See tests/integration/README.md for more details.

# Note: Mythic does not provide a simple Docker image for testing.
# It requires the full framework setup with multiple microservices.
